# Income Distribution 
A simulation of how the distribution of income of randomly transacting agents changes through time. The evolving distribution will resolve to a 
stationary distribution which is the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis thereby closely approximating the
actual national income distribution. The simulation is viewed as a statistical mechanic system where particles represent agents, and they release
kinetic energy through random motion which represents money transactions. [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6483)
