# Income Distribution 
A simulation of how the distribution of income of randomly transacting agents changes through time. The evolving distribution will resolve to a 
stationary distribution which is the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis thereby closely approximating the
actual national income distribution. The simulation is viewed as a statistical mechanics system where particles represent agents which release
kinetic energy by colliding with other particles through random motion which represents money transactions.
